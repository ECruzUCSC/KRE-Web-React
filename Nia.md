# Foreword
This guide will cover Nia in an indepth fashion, that is to say it will have the basics, but also some very specific information on how the character works. I intend to cover mostly PvE but will also cover PvP in broad strokes. 

# Character Overview
**Name**: Nia\
**Class**: Assassin\
**Damage Type**: Physical\
**Position**: Front\
**Description**: Nia was once a seldom used character until recent changes brought her some relevance. Now, she is still quite niche, but at the very least she serves some function as both a support and possible DPS in Galgoria. 

As a dps, her main tool is using defense ignore to deal heavy damage to targets with high defense. As a support, her core attribute is damage amplifcation, specifically, physical amp. What allows her to do both these things is her S4, [Demonic Blood], which allows one of her skills to be Enhanced for one use for every 4 skills she uses (including Enhanced skills). The short of it is that enhancing S3, [Demonic Eyes of Petrification], allows her to deal a large burst of defense ignoring damage while enhancing S2, [On the Hunt], allows her to stack amp and heal rate reduction on a target.

In practice, this makes Nia very good in Galgoria Stages 7-9. Galgoria has decently high defense, increasing the value of Nia's defense ignoring properties. It also has very strong healing giving her heal rate reduction some importance. But the main reason to take Nia in Galgoria is that when doing Galgoria at stages 7 and above, you're required to have one assassin. Unfortunately, physical team compositions are lacking in full-support assassins. As a result, assassins that have *some* supporting capabilities and/or high damage output are highly valued. It is worth noting that Nia's greatest competition for this party slot is Gladi. Tanya can also fill this role, but not nearly as often.

Unfortunately, Nia does not see much usage in PvE outside of Galgoria. She can function as a decent tank in Trial of the Sky and even as a dps when given an A2 soul weapon. She does decently well in clearing content, but the reason why she's seldom used is because her potential in scoring content is quite low. Because defense ignore is such a strong mechanic, it often comes with the drawback of low raw damage output.
