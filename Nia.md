# Foreword
This guide will cover Nia in an indepth fashion, that is to say it will have the basics, but also some very specific information on how the character works. I intend to cover mostly PvE but will also cover PvP in broad strokes. 

# Character Overview
![Nia Thumbnail](https://github.com/ECruzUCSC/KRE-Web-React/blob/gh-pages/assets/HeroThumbnails/Assassin/assassin_portrait10_nia.png)\
**Name**: Nia\
**Class**: Assassin\
**Damage Type**: Physical\
**Position**: Front\
**Description**: Nia was once a seldom used character until recent changes brought her some relevance. Now, she is still quite niche, but at the very least she serves some function as both a support and possible DPS in Galgoria. 

As a dps, her main tool is using defense ignore to deal heavy damage to targets with high defense. As a support, her core attribute is damage amplifcation, specifically, physical amp. What allows her to do both these things is her S4, [Demonic Blood], which allows one of her skills to be Enhanced for one use for every 4 skills she uses (including Enhanced skills). The short of it is that enhancing S3, [Demonic Eyes of Petrification], allows her to deal a large burst of defense ignoring damage while enhancing S2, [On the Hunt], allows her to stack amp and heal rate reduction on a target.

In practice, this makes Nia very good in Galgoria Stages 7-9. Galgoria has decently high defense, increasing the value of Nia's defense ignoring properties. It also has very strong healing giving her heal rate reduction some importance. But the main reason to take Nia in Galgoria is that when doing Galgoria at stages 7 and above, you're required to have one assassin. Unfortunately, physical team compositions are lacking in full-support assassins. As a result, assassins that have *some* supporting capabilities and/or high damage output are highly valued. It is worth noting that Nia's greatest competition for this party slot is Gladi. Tanya can also fill this role, but not nearly as often.

Unfortunately, Nia does not see much usage in PvE outside of Galgoria. She can function as a decent tank in Trial of the Sky and even as a dps when given an A2 soul weapon. She does decently well in clearing content, but the reason why she's seldom used is because her potential in scoring content is quite low. Because defense ignore is such a strong mechanic, it often comes with the drawback of low raw damage output.

### Breakdown
#### Player Description

#### Analysis - Core Use
Out of Nia's skills, S1 is probably the worst. Theoretically, you can do some pretty funny stuff with it. Namely, you can drag an enemy across multiple screens of space using S1E. However, that would mean expending your enhanced skill on S1, which has decent raw damage, but does not have defense ignore making its damage output mediocre at best. Furthermore, you can not effectively drag a mob that is cc immune, has even a little bit of cc res or dodge. This is because for the drag to occur, Nia has to land 8 consecutive ccs. As a result of everything, S1 should strictly be used to gain stacks of S4 and that's it.

#### Transcendence Perks
The perks are mostly inert. For PvE, Nia is limited by cooldowns, not mana. Enemies in PvE also don't have mana with the exception of both forms of Shakmeh. So both S1L and S1D are useless. In PvP, the mana shenanigans (for both S1L and S1D) seems usable, but Nia has much better things to spend TP on. At most you will gain 800 mana or reduce 1 opponent's mana by 800. At that point, it is better to focus on raw stats.

#### PvP
In PvE S1E should never be used unless the goal is to rack up hit counts. Though at this point, what you should be doing is turning auto off on Nia and letting her just auto attack. In PvP, S1E shouldn't be used either. There are some fringe cases when it can be used, but they are exceptions and not the rule. These cases depend on S2 and S3 being bad choices for the situation, not S1E being good. It is worth noting that when you are using S1 (not S1E), positions can shift around drastically. Try to be attentive to Nia's position after S1 as it can really change up what enhanced skill you should be using when S4 hits.

**Relevance** | PvE: None, PvP: Medium
**In-Game Text** | [Hunt Mark] and [Enhanced Hunt Mark] cannot be dispelled by skills that remove negative effects.

### Breakdown
#### Player Description

#### Analysis
As a PvE support, this is the skill that defines Nia. The values of the base skill aren't too impressive, but the effects of S2 and S2E can be stacked. **This brings the totals to 60% amp, which can go up to 100% amp with a 5* UT2, and 75% heal rate reduction.** Compared to Gladi, this combination offers 50% more amp (with a 5* UT2) and the heal rate reduction. This is the skill that makes Nia as a viable choice in Galgoria even without being a dps.

#### S2E's Inconsistency
While this skill has a lot of potential, Nia will only tap into this potential with 33% uptime maximum. The unfortunate truth of Nia on auto is that when S4 activates, all skills reset their cooldown meaning the next skill used to be randomly chosen. There is a 1 in 3 chance that S2E will be chosen. Some people theorized that if you take S2L, you can make Nia behave consistently if she is in the sub team. This is **not** the case. The way sub team skill selection works is heroes will prioritize using ANY skill they can currently use. This is the reason why you often see heroes choose the lowest mana choice. Because they get to that mana amount faster, they will use that skill earlier. However, All of Nia's skills cost 3 mana so they have equal weight. Even if you lower S2E's cost down to 2, Nia will often have near full mana upon activating S4 making the next skill completely random. **In short, Nia's potential support is much better than Gladi's but is very inconsistent.**

#### S2E's Damage
On the damage front, S2's damage is also mediocre. It has defense ignore unlike S1, but it doesn't have very many modifiers from other sources.

#### PvP
In PvP, S2 is a useful tool for getting into the enemy's backline especially when you take S2L, reducing the mana cost to 2. Unfortunately, S1 can often mess up this favorable positioning, but at the very least you can start off with a predictable way to jump to the back. Once S4 activates, S2E can be used to one shot squishy targets if the positioning allows for it. This will seldom be the case though as the second S2 will often jump Nia back to the front (since she will most likely be in the back). Still, if S1 causes position changes that allow Nia to jump to the back with S2E and the furthest target is a squishy target, S2E has the damage potential to do it.

#### PvP - Transcendence Perks
S2D can also be taken so that the amp of S2 can not be cleansed. Oftentimes, that amp will make or break a burst against a bruiser comp. There are fringe cases where you want to S2 and S2E consecutively. Doing so dispels everyone in the enemy team and stacks on the afforementioned debuffs allowing for a strong burst. This can be used in tandem with another dps or if you feel confident that Nia will not be interrupted setting up a soul weapon double enhanced skill combo (which is often unsafe).

**In short, S2L is a solid perk choice for PvP, but S2D can be useful against bruiser comps.**

**Relevance** | PvE: Core, PvP: None
**In-Game Text** | Increases DMG to Non-Hero enemies by 100% for the skill duration.

### Breakdown
#### Player Description

#### Analysis - Core Use
Plain and simple, this is the skill that allows Nia to do some real DPS, both in PvE and PvP. When you enhance S3, it deals 3 hits of the listed damage that has defense ignore. This means that it deals approximately 3x as much damage as S2E (which also has defense ignore). The icing on the cake is that it also deals 9 seconds of cc bar damage because it counts as 3 hits of 3 seconds of cc.

#### AoE
The AoE of S3E is absolutely massive for a character that has single target attacks otherwise. Unfortunately, it is not screenwide so Nia does not function well in Velkazar nor can she clear the screen in Ascalon. However, the AoE is wide enough to kill multiple totems in Trial of the Sky (allowing Nia to do Sky easily if she has an A2), hit all 3 targets in WB3 and hit every character in PvP given Nia is standing either at the front or at the very back.

#### PvP
Speaking of PvP, S3E is also Nia's win condition in PvP. If Nia's given the chance to charge up S4, S3E can one shot moderately tanky teams. For the teams that can survive this, another S3 will be ready in a few seconds if Nia possesses an A2. As a result, Nia is a magnificent bruiser killer due to S3E. There are some problems, however. In order to get to S3E, a player has to buy enough time for Nia to generate 11 mana. S4D will take care of 2 mana meaning Nia has to get 9 mana from auto attacks or the team and that takes some time. Coupled with the fact that Nia does not have much in terms of defensive utility, this makes Nia quite vulnerable to burst comps.

#### PvP - Playing Around S3E
Unfortunately, having all of your damage loaded in one skill makes Nia quite predictable. A skilled opponent will watch the number of skills Nia used so that they can either shield the damage dealt by S3 or outright interrupt it. UT4's cc immunity will help with the latter issue, but a simple dispel will nullify the protection it grants. If at all possible, try to make it so you get to S4 and S3E when the opponent is not ready to dispel as this is the leading cause of interruptions. A player can attempt to be tricky and use an odd skill sequence (saving S2 to activate S4 for example) or skill timing in order to circumvent opponents from predicting when S3E will come out. Unconventional openings means that Nia opens slower and/or more dangerously.

#### PvP - Positioning
It was mentioned in a previous section that AoE can hit everyone on the enemy team in a PvP match. However, this is only true if Nia is in the front or at the very back. The main issue with using S3 is when Nia is somewhere in the middle. Nia's S3 will almost always prioritize position 1 even when she's not next to them. This means Nia will completely miss the backline heroes which are often the actual priority targets. This is more common than one might think considering S1 has a tendency to really shift the positioning of everyone in the enemy team. Before you let S3E rip, make sure you consider the positioning of Nia and the enemy heroes just incase it's better to use S2E or even S1E. A vast majority of the time though, you will be opting to use your enhanced skill on S3E.

**Relevance** | PvE: Core, PvP: Core
**In-Game Text** | Upon gaining 4 stacks of [Demonic Blood], recovers 2 orbs of Mana and increases own ATK by 50% for 5 sec.

### Breakdown
#### Player Description

#### Analysis - Core Use
S4 is the skill that allows Nia to use her enhanced skills. After 4 skill uses, an enhanced skill becomes available. Upon activating this state, all cooldowns are reset meaning you can use any enhanced skill. An interesting tidbit is that enhanced skills also count towards the 4 skill uses. Unfortunately it doesn't help much because all skills share cooldowns with their enhanced skills. Because you need 4 skill uses and Nia's cooldowns are fairly high, enhanced skills do not become available very often.

#### Soul Weapon Combo
Nia's SW on A2 helps with this by adding 2 charges of S4. By using this property, you can use 2 enhanced skills in quick succession. The most practical use of this would be using the following sequence for maximum damage:\
Activate S4 normally\
S3E - Bringing you to 1 stack of S4\
S2 - 2 S4 stacks\
A2 SW Activation - 4 S4 stacks\
S3E\
This Soul Weapon combo can also be used in PvP to get two quick successive bursts, but it is easily interrupted by an attentive opponent. Unfortunately, there is no practical usage of the A2 combo when it comes to supporting. The extra enhanced skill can be used to get a better uptime on S2E (granted Nia is being controlled manually), but it only helps very slightly as S2E is active approximately 60-75% of the time.

#### Transcendence Perks
The only transcendence perk that sees use is S4D. In PvE, the boosts provided by S4L are unnecessary. You'd only ever take S4D for the increase in damage. And in PvP, while S4L can help with Nia's sustainability, Nia typically is not looking for a long game. Matches are often decided by whether or not Nia can get to the enhanced skill and whether the chosen enhanced skill is able to completely burst down a key target. If Nia fails to kill a key target by the time her Soul Weapon combo is done, then it often means that the Nia player will lose.

#### Unique Treasure and PvP in general
UT4 allows Nia to start with 1 charge of S4. That means that Nia only has to use 3 skills in order to get to her first enhanced skill. For PvE, this is pretty useless unless the goal is to get a very quick burst of defense ignore damage to instantly clear a stage. In PvP however, this UT is her staple UT. Not having to wait 15-20 seconds before Nia reaches her win condition is an absolute necessity in today's very fast paced meta. Additionally, upon reaching 4 stacks of S4, UT4 will give Nia CC immunity for a short period of time. This is enough time for Nia to execute her first enhanced skill in relative safety. However, an attentive opponent can keep track of Nia's skill usages and either dispel when the time comes or prepare a skill that prevents buffs from being applied. When this happens, the cc immunity affords Nia no safety. Finally, the cc immunity often does not last long enough to protect the SW activation that comes after the first enhanced skill. Do not make the assumption that the SW activation is safe because of UT4.

### Breakdown
In PvE, there is no question that you take T1 Atk and Monster Hunting if you play Nia as a DPS. If you play her as a support, you could still take those two perks, or you can change her perks to something more defensive if survivability is a huge issue. Finally, if you are using Nia as a Sky Trial tank, then you definitely want to take the defensive T1's.

In PvP, the first four perks will have some relevance depending on what TM skills Nia has built at the time. Each of the skills is straightforward enough that you can tell how it will impact your build. The only thing that warrants saying is that if you are using one instance of [-Def/+Atk], you might want to consider picking up T1 Def to offset the defense loss. The key is figuring out how to balance your stats. I would love to cover that, but this is not the guide to do so.

### Breakdown
For PvE, Nia's T2 skills are not as straightforward as they seem. Target Weakness is oddly good despite giving penetration, a stat that Nia does not need. Opportune Strike is oddly mediocre because Nia has so much critical hit rate that the crit on Opportune Strike itself is wasted. So the choice comes down to the 20% perk layer atk from Target Weakness or 30% critical damage from Opportune Strike. The answer will depend on how much crit damage Nia has at the time of execution. In a vacuum, Target Weakness is better. If Nia is overflowing with crit dmg because Lavril and other crit dmg buffers are in the party, then Target Weakness is better. But if the supports are focused on buffing attack instead, then Opportune Strike overtakes Target Weakness.

For PvP, T2 perks give Nia an opportunity to fill in missing stats. Target Weakness provides Nia with the 20% perk layer buff which is always appreciated as a character who serves as a win condition. However, 20% atk often pales in comparison when using the TM skill [-def/+atk]. Tactical Foresight used to be a core perk as dodge only appreciates in value the more you build it. Nia already has high dodge as an assassin which only gets higher as S4 stacks. However, because of the recent shift in building convention, more and more accuracy is present in the meta neutralizing dodge almost entirely. As a result, Tactical Foresight can give you big returns against an inexperienced player, but is less valuable against better competitors. As previously mentioned, Nia already has high critical hit rate. But going above 100% with Opportune Strike is not wrong because tankier teams tend to build critical resistance.

### Breakdown
In PvE, take both. The stats from T5L area always appreciated and Nia does not have very many good T3 perks giving you room to take T5L. T5D is also decent for bumping up Nia's damage. Despite its defense ignore, T5D is not a massive damage dealer due to the low scaling, but it still adds damage to the table due to Nia's high auto hit count. Speaking of hit count, taking T5D and leaving Nia to just auto attack allows her to shred hit count barriers really quickly.

In contrast, T5D is awful in PvP. The amount of damage it adds on is easily healed off. Nia's win condition is getting off a big S3E depleting the opponent's health all in one go, not chipping them down. T5D does not help in the slightest with this goal. T5L on the other hand will provide her with survivability, damage and helps mana generation with the attack speed.

## Generic PvE

### Breakdown
**Used in:** Pretty much anywhere in PvE that isn't Sky Trial / Hero content\
**80 TP:** Drop T5L\
As stated, you can use this build pretty much anywhere. Even though the goal of the build is to maximize Nia's damage, even support Nia should be running this. The only potential difference would be to change T1 atk for T1 hp or T1 def if support Nia's survivability is low for whatever reason. Finally, if you're doing hero content (DL, Hero ToC floors), make sure you swap out S3D for something else.

## Sky Tank

### Breakdown
**Used in:** Sky Trial\
**80 TP:** Drop Monster Hunting\
Nia's perk build if used as a tank for sky trial. Nia doesn't have too many perks that help with this endeavor. This is pretty much all she could take that has any sort of impact on her performance. Building her for damage when she's built as the tank is highly ineffective so most of these perks are defensive in nature.

## PvP
**Disclaimer:** This build is not static. PvP is very nuanced and perks will change based on playstyle preference and team comp. This is simply the one I use most often.
