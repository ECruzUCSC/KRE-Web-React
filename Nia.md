# Foreword
This guide will cover Nia in an indepth fashion, that is to say it will have the basics, but also some very specific information on how the character works. I intend to cover mostly PvE but will also cover PvP in broad strokes. 

# Character Overview
![Nia Thumbnail](https://github.com/ECruzUCSC/KRE-Web-React/blob/gh-pages/assets/HeroThumbnails/Assassin/assassin_portrait10_nia.png)\
**Name**: Nia\
**Class**: Assassin\
**Damage Type**: Physical\
**Position**: Front\
**Description**: Nia was once a seldom used character until recent changes brought her some relevance. Now, she is still quite niche, but at the very least she serves some function as both a support and possible DPS in Galgoria. 

As a dps, her main tool is using defense ignore to deal heavy damage to targets with high defense. As a support, her core attribute is damage amplifcation, specifically, physical amp. What allows her to do both these things is her S4, [Demonic Blood], which allows one of her skills to be Enhanced for one use for every 4 skills she uses (including Enhanced skills). The short of it is that enhancing S3, [Demonic Eyes of Petrification], allows her to deal a large burst of defense ignoring damage while enhancing S2, [On the Hunt], allows her to stack amp and heal rate reduction on a target.

In practice, this makes Nia very good in Galgoria Stages 7-9. Galgoria has decently high defense, increasing the value of Nia's defense ignoring properties. It also has very strong healing giving her heal rate reduction some importance. But the main reason to take Nia in Galgoria is that when doing Galgoria at stages 7 and above, you're required to have one assassin. Unfortunately, physical team compositions are lacking in full-support assassins. As a result, assassins that have *some* supporting capabilities and/or high damage output are highly valued. It is worth noting that Nia's greatest competition for this party slot is Gladi. Tanya can also fill this role, but not nearly as often.

Unfortunately, Nia does not see much usage in PvE outside of Galgoria. She can function as a decent tank in Trial of the Sky and even as a dps when given an A2 soul weapon. She does decently well in clearing content, but the reason why she's seldom used is because her potential in scoring content is quite low. Because defense ignore is such a strong mechanic, it often comes with the drawback of low raw damage output.

### Breakdown
**Player Description: **

**Analysis:** Out of Nia's skills, S1 is probably the worst. Theoretically, you can do some pretty funny stuff with it. Namely, you can drag an enemy across multiple screens of space using S1E. However, that would mean expending your enhanced skill on S1, which has decent raw damage, but does not have defense ignore making its damage output mediocre at best. Furthermore, you can not effectively drag a mob that is cc immune, has even a little bit of cc res or dodge. This is because for the drag to occur, Nia has to land 8 consecutive ccs.

The perks are mostly inert. For PvE, Nia is limited by cooldowns, not mana. Enemies in PvE also don't have mana with the exception of both forms of Shakmeh. So both S1L and S1D are useless. In PvP, the mana shenanigans (for both S1L and S1D) seems usable, but Nia has much better things to spend TP on. At most you will gain 800 mana or reduce 1 opponent's mana by 800. At that point, it is better to focus on raw stats.

As a result of everything, S1 should strictly be used to gain stacks of S4 and that's it. In PvE S1E should never be used unless the goal is to rack up hit counts. Though at this point, what you should be doing is turning auto off on Nia and letting her just auto attack. In PvP, S1E shouldn't be used either. There are some fringe cases when it can be used, but they are exceptions and not the rule. These cases depend on S2 and S3 being bad choices for the situation, not S1E being good. It is worth noting that when you are using S1 (not S1E), positions can shift around drastically. Try to be attentive to Nia's position after S1 as it can really change up what enhanced skill you should be using when S4 hits.

## S2

### Breakdown
**Player Description: **

**Analysis:** As a PvE support, this is the skill that defines Nia. The base skill gives 20% amp, which can go up to 40% amp with a 5* UT2. It also reduces enemy heal rate by 25%. That's not too much on its own, but S2 and S2E can be stacked. This brings the totals to 60% amp, which can go up to 100% amp with a 5* UT2, and 75% heal rate reduction. Compared to Gladi, this combination offers 50% more amp (with a 5* UT2) and the heal rate reduction. This is the skill that makes Nia as a viable choice in Galgoria even without being a dps.

While this skill has a lot of potential, Nia will only tap into this potential with 33% uptime maximum. The unfortunate truth of Nia on auto is that when S4 activates, all skills reset their cooldown meaning the next skill used to be randomly chosen. There is a 1 in 3 chance that S2E will be chosen. Some people theorized that if you take S2L, you can make Nia behave consistently if she is in the sub team. This is **not** the case. The way sub team skill selection works is heroes will prioritize using ANY skill they can currently use. This is the reason why you often see heroes choose the lowest mana choice. Because they get to that mana amount faster, they will use that skill earlier. However, All of Nia's skills cost 3 mana so they have equal weight. Even if you lower S2E's cost down to 2, Nia will often have near full mana upon activating S4 making the next skill completely random. **In short, Nia's potential support is much better than Gladi's but is very inconsistent.**

On the damage front, S2's damage is also mediocre. It has defense ignore unlike S1, but it doesn't have very many modifiers from other sources.

In PvP, S2 is a useful tool for getting into the enemy's backline especially when you take S2L, reducing the mana cost to 2. Unfortunately, S1 can often mess up this favorable positioning, but at the very least you can start off with a predictable way to jump to the back. Once S4 activates, S2E can be used to one shot squishy targets if the positioning allows for it. This will seldom be the case though as the first S2 will often jump Nia back to the front (since she will most likely be in the back). Still, if S1 causes position changes that allow Nia to jump to the back with S2E and the furthest target is a squishy target, S2E has the damage potential to do it.

S2D can also be taken so that the amp of S2 can not be cleansed. Oftentimes, that amp will make or break a burst against a bruiser comp. There are fringe cases where you want to S2 and S2E consecutively. Doing so dispels everyone in the enemy team and stacks on the afforementioned debuffs allowing for a strong burst. This can be used in tandem with another dps or if you feel confident that Nia will not be interrupted setting up a soul weapon double enhanced skill combo (which is often unsafe).

**In short, S2L is a solid perk choice for PvP, but S2D can be useful against bruiser comps.**
